# Overview

I created a basic 4 fuction calculator to demonstrate how switch case works in C++

I wanted to learn how to code basic functions and how to format things in C++.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community. This is a free software to download and use. I used this because it was recommended for beginners and it had most of the debugger requirements already installed

I used C++ for this project, and the two additional libraries I used were "iostream" and "cmath"

# Future Work

- Item 1 I want to add a loop that will allow you to continue inputting equations
- Item 2 I want to add additional inputs to be able to calculate more than 2 numbers at a time
